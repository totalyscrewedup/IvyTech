              Use case:
              *********
This program is used to keep track of available runs inside
an animal boarding facility. The GUI is providing the means 
to gather user selection while the verification algorithm 
checks user input for typos and logical errors.
    Instructions:
The program is providing an interface that includes 10 dark red buttons for 
selection of type of run you would like to utilize for the boarding pet. 
Right beside the buttons is the field depicting the run availability, 
respectively. Aside from the Welcoming label in read, with the inscription 
“Welcome to FurBaby Boarding!”, you have the main display with the same 
inscription that also functions as an entry field.

The steps you should take are as follows:
1.	Click on the type of run to be utilized.
2.	This will show the change of available runs in the field adjacent to
the button clicked. Also, the ‘Main Display’ field will now show instructions
to be followed.
3.	Click on the ‘Main Display’
4.	Enter the day on which the pet will be leaving our boarding facility
5.	Click on ‘Enter’ button. Please note that the button will remain 
disabled until you click on the run selection button!
6.	Please utilize the date format: mm-dd-yyyy
7.	If you make a mistake, the display field will prompt you with the 
instructions to be taken to correct it.
8.	Once the correct date has been entered, you will be prompted to enter
pet information and you will be provided with current date and time stamp that
will be logged at a later time, automatically.
9.	Click on ‘Save’ button to exit the screen and return to main interface
for next pet boarding.
